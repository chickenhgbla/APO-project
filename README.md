  Submit your report (one report per pair) on Blackboard by 4.30pm on Thursday 12
  Send your GAMS file to mohamed.maher18@imperial.ac.uk
  
- Propose a mathematical formulation for the design problem, implement it in GAMS
and identify an optimal refrigerant, using a local or global solver.
- Using integer cuts, identify 10 possible refrigerants that should be investigated further,
commenting on the suitability of the compounds you have found.
- Propose three additional constraints that you could use to improve the mathematical
formulation. Do not implement them.
- Write a report of no more than 8 pages on your findings. Use margins of 2.5 cm
throughout, a line spacing of 1.2 and 11 point Arial font.
